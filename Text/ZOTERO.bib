  abstract = {In four-dimensional geometry, the 24-cell is the convex regular 4-polytope (four-dimensional analogue of a Platonic solid) with Schl{\"a}fli symbol \{3,4,3\}. It is also called C24, or the icositetrachoron, octaplex (short for "octahedral complex"), icosatetrahedroid, octacube, hyper-diamond or polyoctahedron, being constructed of octahedral cells. The boundary of the 24-cell is composed of 24 octahedral cells with six meeting at each vertex, and three at each edge. Together they have 96 triangular faces, 96 edges, and 24 vertices. The vertex figure is a cube. The 24-cell is self-dual. The 24-cell and the tesseract are the only convex regular 4-polytopes in which the edge length equals the radius. The 24-cell does not have a regular analogue in 3 dimensions. It is the only one of the six convex regular 4-polytopes which is not the four-dimensional analogue of one of the five regular Platonic solids. It is the unique regular polytope, in any number of dimensions, which has no regular analogue in the adjacent dimension, either below or above. However, it can be seen as the analogue of a pair of irregular solids: the cuboctahedron and its dual the rhombic dodecahedron. Translated copies of the 24-cell can tile four-dimensional space face-to-face, forming the 24-cell honeycomb. As a polytope that can tile by translation, the 24-cell is an example of a parallelotope, the simplest one that is not also a zonotope.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their formal reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematics. The GSM8K benchmark is widely used to assess the mathematical reasoning of models on grade-school-level questions. While the performance of LLMs on GSM8K has significantly improved in recent years, it remains unclear whether their mathematical reasoning capabilities have genuinely advanced, raising questions about the reliability of the reported metrics. To address these concerns, we conduct a largescale study on several state-of-the-art open and closed models. To overcome the limitations of existing evaluations, we introduce GSM-Symbolic, an improved benchmark created from symbolic templates that allow for the generation of a diverse set of questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations, providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the reasoning capabilities of models.Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit noticeable variance when responding to different instantiations of the same question. Specifically, the performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered in the GSM-Symbolic benchmark. Furthermore, we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models and demonstrate that their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this decline is due to the fact that current LLMs are not capable of genuine logical reasoning; instead, they attempt to replicate the reasoning steps observed in their training data. When we add a single clause that appears relevant to the question, we observe significant performance drops (up to 65\%) across all state-of-the-art models, even though the added clause does not contribute to the reasoning chain needed to reach the final answer. Overall, our work provides a more nuanced understanding of LLMs' capabilities and limitations in mathematical reasoning.},

  abstract = {We present a connection between the physics of cosmological time evolution and the wavefunction of the universe, and the mathematics of positive geometries, roughly analogous to similar connections seen in the context of scattering amplitudes. We consider the late-time wavefunction of the universe in a class of toy models of scalars with time-dependent coupling constants, including conformally coupled scalars (with non-conformal interactions) in FRW cosmologies as a special case. The contribution of each Feynman diagram to the wavefunction of the universe is associated with a certain universal rational integrand. We show that this integrand can be identified with the canonical form of a ``cosmological polytope''. These polytopes have an intrinsic definition making no reference to physics, and the connection to ``time'', along with familiar properties of the wavefunction, arises from this definition. In particular the singularity structure of the wavefunction for this toy model of scalars is common to all theories, and is geometrized by the cosmological polytope. A natural triangulation of the polytope is associated with the time-integral representation of the wavefunction; another natural triangulation of the dual polytope reproduces ``old-fashioned perturbation theory''. Other triangulations are associated with efficient recursive computations of the wavefunction, while recently discovered new representations for the canonical forms of general polytopes give new representations of the wavefunction with no extant physical interpretation. We show in some examples how symmetries of the cosmological polytope descend to symmetries of the wavefunction, (such as conformal invariance of deSitter wavefunctions). In cases such as {$\varphi$}3 theory in dS4, the final wavefunction obtained from integration of the rational functions gives rise to polylogarithms associated with every graph. We give an explicit expression for the symbol of these polylogs, which record the geometry of sequential projections of the cosmological polytope.},

The theories can be seen as presentations of Boolean algebras, and the collections of models can be topologized in such a way that the theory can be recovered from its space of models. The situation can be cast as a formal duality relating two categories of syntax and semantics, mediated by homming into a common dualizing object, in this case 2. In the present work, we generalize the entire arrangement from propositional to first-order logic. Boolean algebras are replaced by Boolean categories presented by theories in first-order logic, and spaces of models are replaced by topological groupoids of models and their isomorphisms. A duality between the resulting categories of syntax and semantics, expressed first in the form of a contravariant adjunction, is established by homming into a common dualizing object, now \${\textbackslash}Sets\$, regarded once as a boolean category, and once as a groupoid equipped with an intrinsic topology. The overall framework of our investigation is provided by topos theory. Direct proofs of the main results are given, but the specialist will recognize toposophical ideas in the background. Indeed, the duality between syntax and semantics is really a manifestation of that between algebra and geometry in the two directions of the geometric morphisms that lurk behind our formal theory. Along the way, we construct the classifying topos of a decidable coherent theory out of its groupoid of models via a simplified covering theorem for coherent toposes.},

  abstract = {Lawvere showed that generalised metric spaces are categories enriched over \$[0, {\textbackslash}infty]\$, the quantale of the positive extended reals. The statement of enrichment is a quantitative analogue of being a preorder. Towards seeking a logic for quantitative metric reasoning, we investigate three \$[0,{\textbackslash}infty]\$-valued propositional logics over the Lawvere quantale. The basic logical connectives shared by all three logics are those that can be interpreted in any quantale, viz finite conjunctions and disjunctions, tensor (addition for the Lawvere quantale) and linear implication (here a truncated subtraction); to these we add, in turn, the constant \$1\$ to express integer values, and scalar multiplication by a non-negative real to express general affine combinations. Quantitative equational logic can be interpreted in the third logic if we allow inference systems instead of axiomatic systems. For each of these logics we develop a natural deduction system which we prove to be decidably complete w.r.t. the quantale-valued semantics. The heart of the completeness proof makes use of the Motzkin transposition theorem. Consistency is also decidable; the proof makes use of Fourier-Motzkin elimination of linear inequalities. Strong completeness does not hold in general, even (as is known) for theories over finitely-many propositional variables; indeed even an approximate form of strong completeness in the sense of Pavelka or Ben Yaacov -- provability up to arbitrary precision -- does not hold. However, we can show it for theories axiomatized by a (not necessarily finite) set of judgements in normal form over a finite set of propositional variables when we restrict to models that do not map variables to \${\textbackslash}infty\$; the proof uses Hurwicz's general form of the Farkas' Lemma.},

People resort to reading growth hacker blogs or going to meetups or eventually asking consultants for help. This book contains a library of techniques and specific guidance on how to rapidly test new business ideas in the market with customers, using the world renowned Business Model Canvas. The book has three parts. The first explains how Lean Experiments dramatically reduce risk and increase the likelihood of success for any new business idea. The second part introduces Assumptions Mapping and an experiment library. The third part defines a series of ceremonies and team configurations to make experimentation a continuous, repeatable process. The book concludes with a challenge to founders and executives on how to encourage an experimentation mindset within their organizations"--},

Leibniz thus hoped to create a language usable within the framework of a universal logical calculation or calculus ratiocinator. The characteristica universalis is a recurring concept in the writings of Leibniz. When writing in French, he sometimes employed the phrase sp{\'e}cieuse g{\'e}n{\'e}rale to the same effect. The concept is sometimes paired with his notion of a calculus ratiocinator and with his plans for an encyclopaedia as a compendium of all human knowledge.},

This mathematical framework enables us to compute the meaning of a well-typed sentence from the meanings of its constituents. Concretely, the type reductions of Pregroups are `lifted' to morphisms in a category, a procedure that transforms meanings of constituents into a meaning of the (well-typed) whole. Importantly, meanings of whole sentences live in a single space, independent of the grammatical structure of the sentence. Hence the inner-product can be used to compare meanings of arbitrary sentences, as it is for comparing the meanings of words in the distributional model. The mathematical structure we employ admits a purely diagrammatic calculus which exposes how the information flows between the words in a sentence in order to make up the meaning of the whole sentence. A variation of our `categorical model' which involves constraining the scalars of the vector spaces to the semiring of Booleans results in a Montague-style Boolean-valued semantics.},

However, the meanings of these words differ from author to author, as do the specific bicategories considered.

Using categorical methods, we construct models for parametric and nonparametric Bayesian reasoning on function spaces, thus providing a basis for the supervised learning problem. In particular, stochastic processes are arrows to these function spaces which serve as prior probabilities. The resulting inference maps can often be analytically constructed in this symmetric monoidal weakly closed category. We also show how to view general stochastic processes using functor categories and demonstrate the Kalman filter as an archetype for the hidden Markov model.},

First, we show that Zadeh's extension principle can be justified and at the same time generalized by considerations about transformation of possibility measures. Using these results, we show how linguistic uncertainty about the truth value of a proposition leads to the introduction of the notion of a possibilistic truth value. Since propositions can be combined into new ones using logical operators, linguistic uncertainty about the truth values of the original propositions leads to linguistic uncertainty about the truth value of the resulting proposition. Furthermore, we show that in a number of special cases there is truth-functionality, i.e., the possibilistic truth value of the resulting proposition is a function of the possibilistic truth values of the original propositions. We are thus led to the introduction of possibilistic-logical functions, combining possibilistic truth values. Important classes of such functions, the possibilistic extension logics, directly result from the abovementioned investigation, and are studied extensively. Finally, the relation between these logics, and Kleene's strong multi-valued systems is established.},

  abstract = {Semantic Image Interpretation (SII) is the task of extracting structured semantic descriptions from images. It is widely agreed that the combined use of visual data and background knowledge is of great importance for SII. Recently, Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) approaches have been developed for reasoning under uncertainty and learning in the presence of data and rich knowledge. Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) are an SRL framework which integrates neural networks with first-order fuzzy logic to allow (i) efficient learning from noisy data in the presence of logical constraints, and (ii) reasoning with logical formulas describing general properties of the data. In this paper, we develop and apply LTNs to two of the main tasks of SII, namely, the classification of an image's bounding boxes and the detection of the relevant part-of relations between objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of SRL to such SII tasks. The proposed approach is evaluated on a standard image processing benchmark. Experiments show that the use of background knowledge in the form of logical constraints can improve the performance of purely data-driven approaches, including the state-of-the-art Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Fast R-CNN). Moreover, we show that the use of logical background knowledge adds robustness to the learning system when errors are present in the labels of the training data.},

  abstract = {The electromagnetic spectrum is the full range of electromagnetic radiation, organized by frequency or wavelength. The spectrum is divided into separate bands, with different names for the electromagnetic waves within each band. From low to high frequency these are: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. The electromagnetic waves in each of these bands have different characteristics, such as how they are produced, how they interact with matter, and their practical applications. Radio waves, at the low-frequency end of the spectrum, have the lowest photon energy and the longest wavelengths---thousands of kilometers, or more. They can be emitted and received by antennas, and pass through the atmosphere, foliage, and most building materials. Gamma rays, at the high-frequency end of the spectrum, have the highest photon energies and the shortest wavelengths---much smaller than an atomic nucleus. Gamma rays, X-rays, and extreme ultraviolet rays are called ionizing radiation because their high photon energy is able to  ionize atoms, causing chemical reactions. Longer-wavelength radiation such as visible light is nonionizing; the photons do not have sufficient energy to ionize atoms. Throughout most of the electromagnetic spectrum, spectroscopy can be used to separate waves of different frequencies, so that the intensity of the radiation can be measured as a function of frequency or wavelength. Spectroscopy is used to study the interactions of electromagnetic waves with matter.},

Starting with a review of monoidal categories and their associated graphical languages, we then revisit probability theory from a categorical perspective and introduce Bayesian networks, an existing structure for describing causal relationships. Motivated by these, we propose a new algebraic structure, which we term a causal theory. These take the form of a symmetric monoidal category, with the objects representing variables and morphisms ways of deducing information about one variable from another. A major advantage of reasoning with these structures is that the resulting graphical representations of morphisms match well with intuitions for flows of information between these variables. These categories can then be modelled in other categories, providing concrete interpretations for the variables and morphisms. In particular, we shall see that models in the category of measurable spaces and stochastic maps provide a slight generalisation of Bayesian networks, and naturally form a category themselves. We conclude with a discussion of this category, classifying the morphisms and discussing some basic universal constructions. ERRATA: (i) Pages 41-42: Objects of a causal theory are words, not collections, in \$V\$, and we include swaps as generating morphisms, subject to the identities defining a symmetric monoidal category.

  abstract = {Coalgebra, as the abstract study of state-based systems, comes naturally equipped with a notion of behavioural equivalence that identifies states exhibiting the same behaviour. In many cases, however, this equivalence is finer than the intended semantics. Particularly in automata theory, behavioural equivalence of nondeterministic automata is essentially bisimilarity, and thus does not coincide with language equivalence. Language equivalence can be captured as behavioural equivalence on the determinization, which is obtained via the standard powerset construction. This construction can be lifted to coalgebraic generality, assuming a so-called Eilenberg-Moore distributive law between the functor termining the type of accepted structure (e.g.{\textbackslash} word languages) and a monad capturing the branching type (e.g.{\textbackslash} nondeterministic, weighted, probabilistic). Eilenberg-Moore-style coalgebraic semantics in this sense has been shown to be essentially subsumed by the more general framework of graded semantics, which is centrally based on graded monads. Graded semantics comes with a range of generic results, in particular regarding invariance and, under suitable conditions, expressiveness of dedicated modal logics for a given semantics; notably, these logics are evaluated on the original state space. We show that the instantiation of such graded logics to the case of Eilenberg-Moore-style semantics works extremely smoothly, and yields expressive modal logics in essentially all cases of interest. We additionally parametrize the framework over a quantale of truth values, thus in particular covering both the two-valued notions of equivalence and quantitative ones, i.e. behavioural distances.},

This approach has two main benefits. First, categorical d-separation is a very intuitive criterion based on topological connectedness. Second, our results apply both to measure-theoretic probability (with standard Borel spaces) and beyond probability theory, including to deterministic and possibilistic networks. It therefore provides a clean proof of the equivalence of local and global Markov properties with causal compatibility for continuous and mixed random variables as well as deterministic and possibilistic variables.},

  abstract = {We present our position on the elusive quest for a general-purpose framework for specifying and studying deep learning architectures. Our opinion is that the key attempts made so far lack a coherent bridge between specifying constraints which models must satisfy and specifying their implementations. Focusing on building a such a bridge, we propose to apply category theory---precisely, the universal algebra of monads valued in a 2-category of parametric maps---as a single theory elegantly subsuming both of these flavours of neural network design. To defend our position, we show how this theory recovers constraints induced by geometric deep learning, as well as implementations of many architectures drawn from the diverse landscape of neural networks, such as RNNs. We also illustrate how the theory naturally encodes many standard constructs in computer science and automata theory.},

We propose a novel scene representation to facilitate the geometric reasoning, Directed Spatial Commonsense Graph (D-SCG), a spatial scene graph that is enriched with additional concept nodes from a commonsense knowledge base. Specifically, the nodes of D-SCG represent the scene objects and the edges are their relative positions. Each object node is then connected via different commonsense relationships to a set of concept nodes. With the proposed graph-based scene representation, we estimate the unknown position of the target object using a Graph Neural Network that implements a sparse attentional message passing mechanism. The network first predicts the relative positions between the target object and each visible object by learning a rich representation of the objects via aggregating both the object nodes and the concept nodes in D-SCG. These relative positions then are merged to obtain the final position. We evaluate our method using Partial ScanNet, improving the state-of-the-art by 5.9\% in terms of the localisation accuracy at a 8x faster training speed.},

  abstract = {There is a population explosion among the logical systems used in computing science. Examples include first-order logic, equational logic, Horn-clause logic, higher-order logic, infinitary logic, dynamic logic, intuitionistic logic, order-sorted logic, and temporal logic; moreover, there is a tendency for each theorem prover to have its own idiosyncratic logical system. The concept of               institution               is introduced to formalize the informal notion of ``logical system.'' The major requirement is that there is a satisfaction relation between models and sentences that is consistent under change of notation. Institutions enable abstracting away from syntactic and semantic detail when working on language structure ``in-the-large''; for example, we can   define language features for building large logical system. This applies to both specification languages and programming languages. Institutions also have applications to such areas as database theory and the semantics of artificial and natural languages. A first main result of this paper says that any institution such that signatures (which define notation) can be glued together, also allows gluing together theories (which are just collections of sentences over a fixed signature). A second main result considers when theory structuring is preserved by institution morphisms. A third main result gives conditions under which it is sound to use a theorem prover for one institution on theories from another. A fourth main result shows how to extend institutions so that their theories may include, in addition  to the original sentences, various kinds of constraint that are useful for defining   abstract data types, including both ``data'' and ``hierarchy'' constraints. Further results show how to define institutions that allow sentences and constraints from two or more institutions. All our general results apply to such ``duplex'' and ``multiplex'' institutions.},

Spatial relations represent a class of high-level image features which can improve image annotation. We apply spatial relations to automatic image annotation, a task which is usually a first step towards CBIR. We follow a probabilistic approach to represent different types of spatial relations to improve the automatic annotations which are obtained based on low-level features. Different configurations and subsets of the computed spatial relations were used to perform experiments on a database of landscape images.

Programs may use both higher-order functions and continuous distributions, or even define a probability distribution on functions. But standard probability theory does not handle higher-order functions well: the category of measurable spaces is not cartesian closed. Here we introduce quasi-Borel spaces. We show that these spaces: form a new formalization of probability theory replacing measurable spaces; form a cartesian closed category and so support higher-order functions; form a well-pointed category and so support good proof principles for equational reasoning; and support continuous probability distributions. We demonstrate the use of quasi-Borel spaces for higher-order functions and probability by: showing that a well-known construction of probability theory involving random functions gains a cleaner expression; and generalizing de Finetti's theorem, that is a crucial theorem in probability theory, to quasi-Borel spaces.},

  abstract = {In mathematics, a Hilbert space (named for David Hilbert) generalizes the notion of Euclidean space. It extends the methods of linear algebra and calculus from the two-dimensional Euclidean plane and three-dimensional space to spaces with any finite or infinite number of dimensions. A Hilbert space is a vector space equipped with an inner product operation, which allows lengths and angles to be defined. Furthermore, Hilbert spaces are complete, which means that there are enough limits in the space to allow the techniques of calculus to be used. A Hilbert space is a special case of a Banach space. Hilbert spaces were studied beginning in the first decade of the 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer), and ergodic theory (which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics). John von Neumann coined the term Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean vector spaces, examples of Hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions, spaces of sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions. Geometric intuition plays an important role in many aspects of Hilbert space theory. Exact analogs of the Pythagorean theorem and parallelogram law hold in a Hilbert space. At a deeper level, perpendicular projection onto a linear subspace plays a significant role in optimization problems and other aspects of the theory. An element of a Hilbert space can be uniquely specified by its coordinates with respect to an orthonormal basis, in analogy with Cartesian coordinates in classical geometry. When this basis is countably infinite, it allows identifying the Hilbert space with the space of the infinite sequences that are square-summable. The latter space is often in the older literature referred to as the Hilbert space.},

This is a very efficient way to model high-dimensional data which simultaneously satisfies many different lowdimensional constraints. Each individual expert model can focus on giving high probability to data vectors that satisfy just one of the constraints. Data vectors that satisfy this one constraint but violate other constraints will be ruled out by their low probability under the other expert models. Training a product of models appears difficult because, in addition to maximizing the probabilities that the individual models assign to the observed data, it is necessary to make the models disagree on unobserved regions of the data space: It is fine for one model to assign a high probability to an unobserved region as long as some other model assigns it a very low probability. Fortunately, if the individual models are tractable there is a fairly efficient way to train a product of models. This training algorithm suggests a biologically plausible way of learning neural population codes.},

  abstract = {The public has something of an obsession with love languages, believing that the key to lasting love is for partners to express love in each other's preferred language. Despite the popularity of Chapman's book The 5 Love Languages, there is a paucity of empirical work on love languages, and collectively, it does not provide strong empirical support for the book's three central assumptions that (a) each person has a preferred love language, (b) there are five love languages, and (c) couples are more satisfied when partners speak one another's preferred language. We discuss potential reasons for the popularity of the love languages, including the fact that it enables people to identify important relationship needs, provides an intuitive metaphor that resonates with people, and offers a straightforward way to improve relationships. We offer an alternative metaphor that we believe more accurately reflects a large body of empirical research on relationships: Love is not akin to a language one needs to learn to speak but can be more appropriately understood as a balanced diet in which people need a full range of essential nutrients to cultivate lasting love.},

Fue creado por Katharine Cook Briggs y su hija Isabel Briggs Myers durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, y los criterios utilizados se basan en las propuestas que Carl Gustav Jung public{\'o} en su trabajo Tipos psicol{\'o}gicos.[1]\hspace{0pt}[2]\hspace{0pt} La prueba utiliza cuatro escalas, llamadas dicotom{\'i}as, definidas como pares opuestos entre ocho categor{\'i}as: introversi{\'o}n-extraversi{\'o}n, sensaci{\'o}n-intuici{\'o}n, pensamiento-sentimiento, juicio-percepci{\'o}n. Cada categor{\'i}a es simbolizada por una letra, de modo que el resultado se muestra con una combinaci{\'o}n de cuatro letras, de entre las diecis{\'e}is posibles, que pretende definir la personalidad del sujeto. A pesar de no haber podido demostrar de forma adecuada su fiabilidad como test de personalidad,[3]\hspace{0pt}[4]\hspace{0pt}[5]\hspace{0pt} es empleado como criterio de selecci{\'o}n para clasificaci{\'o}n en pedagog{\'i}a, din{\'a}mica de grupos, capacitaci{\'o}n de personal, asesoramiento matrimonial, y desarrollo personal.

However, their applicability is restricted because of the special operations used in the construction of these integrals. Therefore, we provide a concept of integrals generalizing both the Choquet and the Sugeno case. For functions with values in the nonnegative real numbers, universal integrals are introduced and investigated, which can be defined on arbitrary measurable spaces and for arbitrary monotone measures. For a fixed pseudo-multiplication on the nonnegative real numbers, the smallest and the greatest universal integrals are given. Finally, another construction method for obtaining universal integrals is introduced, and the restriction to the unit interval, i.e., to fuzzy integrals, is considered.},

The answer is, in a sense to be made precise, that a multicategory of one type can be enriched in a multicategory of the type one level up. In the case of ordinary categories this reduces to something surprising: a category may be enriched in an `fc-multicategory', a very general kind of 2-dimensional structure encompassing monoidal categories, plain multicategories, bicategories and double categories. (It turns out that fc-multicategories also provide a natural setting for the bimodules construction.)

Enrichment in an fc-multicategory extends the (more or less well-known) theories of enrichment in a monoidal category, in a bicategory, and in a multicategory. Moreover, fc-multicategories provide a natural setting for the bimodules construction, traditionally performed on suitably cocomplete bicategories.

  abstract = {Generative AI, the most popular current approach to AI, consists of large language models (LLMs) that are trained to produce outputs that are plausible, but not necessarily correct. Although their abilities are often uncanny, they are lacking in aspects of reasoning, leading LLMs to be less than completely trustworthy. Furthermore, their results tend to be both unpredictable and uninterpretable. We lay out 16 desiderata for future AI, and discuss an alternative approach to AI which could theoretically address many of the limitations associated with current approaches: AI educated with curated pieces of explicit knowledge and rules of thumb, enabling an inference engine to automatically deduce the logical entailments of all that knowledge. Even long arguments produced this way can be both trustworthy and interpretable, since the full step-by-step line of reasoning is always available, and for each step the provenance of the knowledge used can be documented and audited. There is however a catch: if the logical language is expressive enough to fully represent the meaning of anything we can say in English, then the inference engine runs much too slowly. That's why symbolic AI systems typically settle for some fast but much less expressive logic, such as knowledge graphs. We describe how one AI system, Cyc, has developed ways to overcome that tradeoff and is able to reason in higher order logic in real time. We suggest that any trustworthy general AI will need to hybridize the approaches, the LLM approach and more formal approach, and lay out a path to realizing that dream.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we explore the categorical foundations of generative AI. Specifically, we investigate a Generative AI Architecture (GAIA) that lies beyond backpropagation, the longstanding algorithmic workhorse of deep learning. Backpropagation is at its core a compositional framework for (un)supervised learning: it can be conceptualized as a sequence of modules, where each module updates its parameters based on information it receives from downstream modules, and in turn, transmits information back to upstream modules to guide their updates. GAIA is based on a fundamentally different hierarchical model. Modules in GAIA are organized into a simplicial complex. Each n-simplicial complex acts like a manager of a business unit: it receives updates from its superiors and transmits information back to its n + 1 subsimplicial complexes that are its subordinates. To ensure this simplicial generative AI organization behaves coherently, GAIA builds on the mathematics of the higher-order category theory of simplicial sets and objects. Computations in GAIA, from query answering to foundation model building, are posed in terms of lifting diagrams over simplicial objects. The problem of machine learning in GAIA is modeled as ``horn" extensions of simplicial sets: each sub-simplicial complex tries to update its parameters in such a way that a lifting diagram is solved. Traditional approaches used in generative AI using backpropagation can be used to solve ``inner" horn extension problems, but addressing ``outer horn" extensions requires a more elaborate framework. At the top level, GAIA uses the simplicial category of ordinal numbers with objects defined as [n], n ⩾ 0 and arrows defined as weakly order-preserving mappings f : [n] {$\rightarrow$} [m], where f (i) {$\leq$} f (j), i {$\leq$} j. This top-level structure can be viewed as a combinatorial ``factory" for constructing, manipulating, and destructing complex objects that can be built out of modular components defined over categories. The second layer of GAIA defines the building blocks of generative AI models as universal coalgebras over categories that can be defined using current generative AI approaches, including Transformers that define a category of permutation-equivariant functions on vector spaces, structured state-space models that define a category over linear dynamical systems, or image diffusion models that define a probabilistic coalgebra over ordinary differential equations. The third layer in GAIA is a category of elements over a (relational) database that defines the data over which foundation models are built. GAIA formulates the machine learning problem of building foundation models as extending functors over categories, rather than interpolating functions on sets or spaces, which yields canonical solutions called left and right Kan extensions. GAIA uses the metric Yoneda Lemma to construct universal representers of objects in non-symmetric generalized metric spaces. GAIA uses a categorical integral calculus of (co)ends to define two families of generative AI systems. GAIA models based on coends correspond to topological generative AI systems, whereas GAIA systems based on ends correspond to probabilistic generative AI systems.},

Resisting the conventional wisdom that says that if the mind is a large neural network it cannot simultaneously be a manipulator of symbols, Marcus outlines a variety of ways in which neural systems could be organized so as to manipulate symbols, and he shows why such systems are more likely to provide an adequate substrate for language and cognition than neural systems that are inconsistent with the manipulation of symbols. Concluding with a discussion of how a neurally realized system of symbol-manipulation could have evolved and how such a system could unfold developmentally within the womb, Marcus helps to set the future agenda of cognitive neuroscience},

  month = mar,
  journal = {Wikipedia},
  urldate = {2025-04-07},
  abstract = {The mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics are those mathematical formalisms that permit a rigorous description of quantum mechanics. This mathematical formalism uses mainly a part of functional analysis, especially Hilbert spaces, which are a kind of linear space. Such are distinguished from mathematical formalisms for physics theories developed prior to the early 1900s by the use of abstract mathematical structures, such as infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces (L2 space mainly), and operators on these spaces. In brief, values of physical observables such as energy and momentum were no longer considered as values of functions on phase space, but as eigenvalues; more precisely as spectral values of linear operators in Hilbert space. These formulations of quantum mechanics continue to be used today. At the heart of the description are ideas of quantum state and quantum observables, which are radically different from those used in previous models of physical reality. While the mathematics permits calculation of many quantities that can be measured experimentally, there is a definite theoretical limit to values that can be simultaneously measured. This limitation was first elucidated by Heisenberg through a thought experiment, and is represented mathematically in the new formalism by the non-commutativity of operators representing quantum observables. Prior to the development of quantum mechanics as a separate theory, the mathematics used in physics consisted mainly of formal mathematical analysis, beginning with calculus, and increasing in complexity up to differential geometry and partial differential equations. Probability theory was used in statistical mechanics. Geometric intuition played a strong role in the first two and, accordingly, theories of relativity were formulated entirely in terms of differential geometric concepts. The phenomenology of quantum physics arose roughly between 1895 and 1915, and for the 10 to 15 years before the development of quantum mechanics (around 1925) physicists continued to think of quantum theory within the confines of what is now called classical physics, and in particular within the same mathematical structures. The most sophisticated example of this is the Sommerfeld--Wilson--Ishiwara quantization rule, which was formulated entirely on the classical phase space.},

Also in model-driven engineering, there is a diversity of diagrams: UML consists of 15 different diagram types, and SysML provides further types. Finally, in software and hardware specification, a variety of formalisms are in use, like Z, VDM, first-order logic, temporal logic etc.},

  urldate = {2024-05-08},
  abstract = {A political spectrum is a system to characterize and classify different political positions in relation to one another. These positions sit upon one or more geometric axes that represent independent political dimensions. The expressions political compass and political map are used to refer to the political spectrum as well, especially to popular two-dimensional models of it. Most long-standing spectra include the left--right dimension as a measure of social, political and economic hierarchy which originally referred to seating arrangements in the French parliament after the Revolution (1789--1799), with radicals on the left and aristocrats on the right. While communism and socialism are usually regarded internationally as being on the left, conservatism and reactionism are generally regarded as being on the right. Liberalism can mean different things in different contexts, being sometimes on the left (social liberalism) and other times on the right (conservative liberalism or classical liberalism). Those with an intermediate outlook are sometimes classified as centrists. Politics that rejects the conventional left--right spectrum is often known as syncretic politics. This form of politics has been criticized as tending to mischaracterize positions that have a logical location on a two-axis spectrum because they seem randomly brought together on a one-axis left--right spectrum. Some political scientists have noted that a single left--right axis is too simplistic and insufficient for describing the existing variation in political beliefs and include other axes to compensate for this problem. Although the descriptive words at polar opposites may vary, the axes of popular biaxial spectra are usually split between economic issues (on a left--right dimension) and socio-cultural issues (on an authority--liberty dimension).},

To model the boundary between neural and symbolic representations, we propose a family of energy-based models, NeSy Energy-Based Models, and show that they are general enough to include NeuPSL and many other NeSy approaches. Using this framework, we show how to seamlessly integrate neural and symbolic parameter learning and inference in NeuPSL. Through an extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the benefits of using NeSy methods, achieving upwards of 30\% improvement over independent neural network models. On a well-established NeSy task, MNIST-Addition, NeuPSL demonstrates its joint reasoning capabilities by outperforming existing NeSy approaches by up to 10\% in low-data settings. Furthermore, NeuPSL achieves a 5\% boost in performance over state-of-the-art NeSy methods in a canonical citation network task with up to a 40 times speed up.},

As these environments are primarily designed by and for humans, incorporating commonsense knowledge regarding objects and their relationships can significantly constrain and enhance the prediction of the scene graph. In this paper, we investigate the application of commonsense knowledge graphs for 3D scene graph prediction on point clouds of indoor scenes. Through experiments conducted on a real-world indoor dataset, we demonstrate that integrating external commonsense knowledge via the message-passing method leads to a 15.0 \% improvement in scene graph prediction accuracy with external knowledge and \$7.96{\textbackslash}\%\$ with internal knowledge when compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. We also tested in the real world with 10 frames per second for scene graph generation to show the usage of the model in a more realistic robotics setting.},

  abstract = {In quantum physics, a quantum state is a mathematical entity that embodies the knowledge of a quantum system. Quantum mechanics specifies the construction, evolution, and measurement of a quantum state. The result is a prediction for the system represented by the state. Knowledge of the quantum state, and the rules for the system's evolution in time, exhausts all that can be known about a quantum system. Quantum states may be defined differently for different kinds of systems or problems. Two broad categories are wave functions describing quantum systems using position or momentum variables and the more abstract vector quantum states. Historical, educational, and application-focused problems typically feature wave functions; modern professional physics uses the abstract vector states. In both categories, quantum states divide into pure versus mixed states, or into coherent states and incoherent states. Categories with special properties include stationary states for time independence and quantum vacuum states in quantum field theory.},

  abstract = {ULLER is a Unified Language for LEarning and Reasoning that encompasses a wide variety of settings, while ensuring that knowledge described in it can be used in existing NeSy systems. ULLER has a firstorder logic syntax. The original ULLER paper already provides three semantics for ULLER, including classical FOL, fuzzy logic, and probabilistic logic. However, each semantics has its own set of rules. We show that these different semantics can be unified into one single framework using monads, a concept known from category theory and from the semantics of side effects in functional languages. We also show that new semantics can be added to ULLER in a modular way. As an example, we will show how to add a semantics for ??? logic to ULLER and explore the relations between the different semantics.},

  author = {Shojaee, Parshin and Mirzadeh, Iman and Alizadeh, Keivan and Horton, Maxwell and Bengio, Samy and Farajtabar, Mehrdad},
  abstract = {Recent generations of frontier language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established mathematical and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from data contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces' structure and quality. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of compositional complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs ``think''. Through extensive experimentation across diverse puzzles, we show that frontier LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having an adequate token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under equivalent inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) lowcomplexity tasks where standard models surprisingly outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where additional thinking in LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models experience complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across puzzles. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and ultimately raising crucial questions about their true reasoning capabilities.},

  abstract = {Differentiable logics (DL) have recently been proposed as a method of training neural networks to satisfy logical specifications. A DL consists of a syntax in which specifications are stated and an interpretation function that translates expressions in the syntax into loss functions. These loss functions can then be used during training with standard gradient descent algorithms. The variety of existing DLs and the differing levels of formality with which they are treated makes a systematic comparative study of their properties and implementations difficult. This paper remedies this problem by suggesting a meta-language for defining DLs that we call the Logic of Differentiable Logics, or LDL. Syntactically, it generalises the syntax of existing DLs to FOL, and for the first time introduces the formalism for reasoning about vectors and learners. Semantically, it introduces a general interpretation function that can be instantiated to define loss functions arising from different existing DLs. We use LDL to establish several theoretical properties of existing DLs and to conduct their empirical study in neural network verification.},

To investigate the categories of being, or simply categories, is to determine the most fundamental and the broadest classes of entities. A distinction between such categories, in making the categories or applying them, is called an ontological distinction. Various systems of categories have been proposed, they often include categories for substances, properties, relations, states of affairs or events. A representative question within the theory of categories might articulate itself, for example, in a query like, "Are universals prior to particulars?"},

  abstract = {The field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (NeSy), which combines learning and reasoning, has recently experienced significant growth. There now are a wide variety of NeSy frameworks, each with its own specific language for expressing background knowledge and how to relate it to neural networks. This heterogeneity hinders accessibility for newcomers and makes comparing different NeSy frameworks challenging. We propose a unified language for NeSy, which we call ULLER, a Unified Language for LEarning and Reasoning. ULLER encompasses a wide variety of settings, while ensuring that knowledge described in it can be used in existing NeSy systems. ULLER has a first-order logic syntax specialised for NeSy for which we provide example semantics including classical FOL, fuzzy logic, and probabilistic logic. We believe ULLER is a first step towards making NeSy research more accessible and comparable, paving the way for libraries that streamline training and evaluation across a multitude of semantics, knowledge bases, and NeSy systems.},

  abstract = {Scene understanding has been of high interest in computer vision. It encompasses not only identifying objects in a scene, but also their relationships within the given context. With this goal, a recent line of works tackles 3D semantic segmentation and scene layout prediction. In our work we focus on scene graphs, a data structure that organizes the entities of a scene in a graph, where objects are nodes and their relationships modeled as edges. We leverage inference on scene graphs as a way to carry out 3D scene understanding, mapping objects and their relationships. In particular, we propose a learned method that regresses a scene graph from the point cloud of a scene. Our novel architecture is based on PointNet and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). In addition, we introduce 3DSSG, a semiautomatically generated dataset, that contains semantically rich scene graphs of 3D scenes. We show the application of our method in a domain-agnostic retrieval task, where graphs serve as an intermediate representation for 3D-3D and 2D-3D matching.},

  title = {Wave Function},
  year = {2024},
  month = nov,
  journal = {Wikipedia},
  urldate = {2024-11-21},
  abstract = {In quantum physics, a wave function (or wavefunction) is a mathematical description of the quantum state of an isolated quantum system. The most common symbols for a wave function are the Greek letters {$\psi$} and {$\Psi$} (lower-case and capital psi, respectively). Wave functions are complex-valued. For example, a wave function might assign a complex number to each point in a region of space. The Born rule provides the means to turn these complex probability amplitudes into actual probabilities. In one common form, it says that the squared modulus of a wave function that depends upon position is the probability density of measuring a particle as being at a given place. The integral of a wavefunction's squared modulus over all the system's degrees of freedom must be equal to 1, a condition called normalization. Since the wave function is complex-valued, only its relative phase and relative magnitude can be measured; its value does not, in isolation, tell anything about the magnitudes or directions of measurable observables. One has to apply quantum operators, whose eigenvalues correspond to sets of possible results of measurements, to the wave function {$\psi$} and calculate the statistical distributions for measurable quantities. Wave functions can be functions of variables other than position, such as momentum. The information represented by a wave function that is dependent upon position can be converted into a wave function dependent upon momentum and vice versa, by means of a Fourier transform. Some particles, like electrons and photons, have nonzero spin, and the wave function for such particles includes spin as an intrinsic, discrete degree of freedom; other discrete variables can also be included, such as isospin. When a system has internal degrees of freedom, the wave function at each point in the continuous degrees of freedom (e.g., a point in space) assigns a complex number for each possible value of the discrete degrees of freedom (e.g., z-component of spin). These values are often displayed in a column matrix (e.g., a 2 {\texttimes} 1 column vector for a non-relativistic electron with spin 1{\textfractionsolidus}2). According to the superposition principle of quantum mechanics, wave functions can be added together and multiplied by complex numbers to form new wave functions and form a Hilbert space.  The inner product between two wave functions is a measure of the overlap between the corresponding physical states and is used in the foundational probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics, the Born rule, relating transition probabilities to inner products.  The Schr{\"o}dinger equation determines how wave functions evolve over time, and a wave function behaves qualitatively like other waves, such as water waves or waves on a string, because the Schr{\"o}dinger equation is mathematically a type of wave equation.  This explains the name "wave function", and gives rise to wave--particle duality.  However, the wave function in quantum mechanics describes a kind of physical phenomenon, as of 2023 still open to different interpretations, which fundamentally differs from that of classic mechanical waves.},

  abstract = {Scene graphs are a compact and explicit representation successfully used in a variety of 2D scene understanding tasks. This work proposes a method to incrementally build up semantic scene graphs from a 3D environment given a sequence of RGB-D frames. To this end, we aggregate PointNet features from primitive scene components by means of a graph neural network. We also propose a novel attention mechanism well suited for partial and missing graph data present in such an incremental reconstruction scenario. Although our proposed method is designed to run on submaps of the scene, we show it also transfers to entire 3D scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms 3D scene graph prediction methods by a large margin and its accuracy is on par with other 3D semantic and panoptic segmentation methods while running at 35Hz.},
